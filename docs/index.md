# About this Course {-}

Reproducibility of data analyses can be enhanced through the use of tools designed to manage the complexity involved in any data analysis designed to address an important scientific question. We focus on a few software tools that aid in project organization, collaboration, auditability of analyses, and maintaining the integrity of data and code. In this course, we view a data analysis as a complex system with many integrated parts that together produce analytic results. The tools we focus on here allow data analysts to diagnose unexpected results, quickly identify problems with data and code, and provide a basis for managing the dynamic nature of data analysis.
