? Why is data sharing important in making an analysis open source?

C) It helps others be able to truly reproduce the analysis by using the same data
C) It helps other people to be able to reproduce the analysis, as they need to attempt the analysis with your data to do so
o) It makes the analysis more complex and difficult to execute
o) It makes it less clear what was done in our analyses
m) It helps others to be able to publish conclusions about our data
m) It exposes personal identifiable information to the public

C) You can protect data and not share it, but share the code in a careful manner that does not expose details about the data.
o) You can make your analysis reproducible but not open source
o) You can make your analysis open source but not reproducible
m) There are no methods that will allow you to share your methods and data in a safe way.
