## Components of reproducibility

? What does "reproducibility on a continuum" mean?

C) Reproducibility that needs iterative work to improve
C) Reproducibility that improves over time through iterations
o) Reproducibility that is dependent on the researcher's expertise
o) Reproducibility that is achievable only for certain types of analyses
m) Reproducibility that can only be achieved with perfect execution
m) Reproducibility that allows everyone everywhere to get the exact same results with your code and data

? Which of the following is not a component of reproducibility?

C) Efficiency
C) Speed
o) Transparency
o) Clarity
m) Accessibility
m) Consistency


? What does "open source" mean in the context of reproducibility?

C) Making data and code available for anyone to access and modify
C) Providing access to the data and code publicly where possible
o) Providing data and code upon request by email
o) Publishing data and code behind a paywall
m) Storing data and code on a personal computer
m) Not keeping the code for an analysis

? Why is data sharing important in making an analysis open source?

C) It helps others be able to truly reproduce the analysis by using the same data
C) It helps other people to be able to reproduce the analysis, as they need to attempt the analysis with your data to do so
o) It makes the analysis more complex and difficult to execute
o) It makes it less clear what was done in our analyses
m) It helps others to be able to publish conclusions about our data
m) It exposes personal identifiable information to the public


? Which of the following is correct about this statement - if your data has PHI or PII you cannot make your analysis open source or reproducible.

C) These are not mutually exclusive goals! Some thoughtful planning and use of controlled access methods can ensure that all individuals' data are well protected!
C) You can protect data and not share it, but share the code in a careful manner that does not expose details about the data.
o) You can make your analysis reproducible but not open source
o) You can make your analysis open source but not reproducible
m) There are no methods that will allow you to share your methods and data in a safe way.
m) Sharing your code is always unsafe when it comes to PHI or PII
